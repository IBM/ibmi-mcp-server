## Step 2: Configuration

Create your environment configuration file:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="NPM Package">
    Create a `.env` file in your current directory:

    ```bash
    cat > .env << 'EOF'
    # IBM i DB2 for i Connection Settings
    DB2i_HOST=your-ibmi-host
    DB2i_USER=your-username
    DB2i_PASS=your-password
    DB2i_PORT=8076
    DB2i_IGNORE_UNAUTHORIZED=true

    # Server Configuration
    MCP_TRANSPORT_TYPE=http
    MCP_HTTP_PORT=3010
    EOF
    ```

    Edit the file and replace the placeholder values with your actual IBM i credentials.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Build from Source">
    Copy the example configuration and edit it:

    ```bash
    # From ibmi-mcp-server directory
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

    Edit the `.env` file with your IBM i connection details:

    ```bash
    # IBM i DB2 for i Connection Settings
    DB2i_HOST=your-ibmi-host
    DB2i_USER=your-username
    DB2i_PASS=your-password
    DB2i_PORT=8076
    DB2i_IGNORE_UNAUTHORIZED=true

    # Server Configuration
    MCP_TRANSPORT_TYPE=http
    MCP_HTTP_PORT=3010
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Warning>
Replace the connection values with your actual IBM i system credentials. The user profile must have appropriate authorities for database operations.
</Warning>

<Warning>
**Mapepire is Required**: Before proceeding, you must have Mapepire running on your IBM i system. Mapepire is a modern database server for IBM i that provides SQL query execution over WebSocket connections, optimized for AI agent workloads. If you haven't installed it yet, follow our [Setup Mapepire guide](/setup-mapepire) to install and configure it. Default port: **8076**.
</Warning>

<Success>
✓ **Verify your configuration:**
- `.env` file exists in the root directory
- `DB2i_HOST` is set to your IBM i hostname (not `127.0.0.1` if running in Docker)
- `DB2i_USER` and `DB2i_PASS` are valid IBM i credentials
- `DB2i_PORT` matches your Mapepire port (default: 8076)

**Having connection issues?** See the [troubleshooting section](#troubleshooting) below.
</Success>

## Step 3: Create Your First SQL Tool

SQL tools are YAML-based configurations that define SQL queries the MCP server can execute. Each tool specifies a data source, parameters, and the SQL statement to run.

### Create Tools Directory

First, create a directory to store your tool configurations:

```bash
mkdir -p tools
```

### Create a Simple Tool Configuration

Create a file named `tools/quickstart.yaml` with the following content:

```yaml
sources:
  ibmi-system:
    host: ${DB2i_HOST}
    user: ${DB2i_USER}
    password: ${DB2i_PASS}
    port: 8076
    ignore-unauthorized: true

tools:
  system_activity:
    source: ibmi-system
    description: "Current system activity information including active jobs and resource utilization"
    parameters: []
    statement: |
      SELECT * FROM TABLE(QSYS2.SYSTEM_ACTIVITY_INFO())

toolsets:
  performance:
    tools:
      - system_activity
```

### Understanding the YAML Structure

The YAML configuration has three main sections:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Sources">
    Defines the IBM i data sources your tools will connect to. The environment variables (`${DB2i_HOST}`, etc.) are automatically replaced with values from your `.env` file.

    ```yaml
    sources:
      ibmi-system:
        host: ${DB2i_HOST}
        user: ${DB2i_USER}
        password: ${DB2i_PASS}
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Tools">
    Defines the SQL operations available to AI agents. Each tool specifies:
    - `source`: Which data source to use
    - `description`: What the tool does (helps AI understand when to use it)
    - `parameters`: Input parameters (empty array `[]` means no parameters required)
    - `statement`: The SQL query to execute

    ```yaml
    tools:
      system_activity:
        source: ibmi-system
        description: "Current system activity information including active jobs and resource utilization"
        parameters: []
        statement: |
          SELECT * FROM TABLE(QSYS2.SYSTEM_ACTIVITY_INFO())
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Toolsets">
    Groups related tools together for easier management. You can load specific toolsets when starting the server using `--toolsets performance`.

    ```yaml
    toolsets:
      performance:
        tools:
          - system_activity
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Success>
✓ **Verify your tool configuration:**
- `tools/quickstart.yaml` file exists
- YAML syntax is valid (no tabs, proper indentation with spaces)
- Environment variables are wrapped in `${}` syntax
- SQL statement uses the pipe `|` character for multi-line strings
</Success>

  **Ready to build more tools?** The SQL Tools documentation covers parameters, validation, multiple data sources, complex queries, and the full YAML configuration reference.
</Card>

## Step 4: Start the Server

Start the server in HTTP mode with your new SQL tool:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="NPM Package (Recommended)">
    ```bash
    export MCP_SERVER_CONFIG=.env
    npx @ibm/ibmi-mcp-server@latest -y --transport http --tools ./tools/quickstart.yaml
    ```

    **Session Modes**:
    - `auto` (default): Automatically detects client capabilities ← **Start with this**
    - `stateful`: Maintains persistent sessions with connection state
    - `stateless`: Each request is independent, no session state

    Set via environment: `MCP_SESSION_MODE=stateful npx @ibm/ibmi-mcp-server@latest -y --transport http`
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Build from Source">
    ```bash
    # From server/ directory
    npm run start:http -- --tools ../tools/quickstart.yaml
    ```

    **Session Modes**:
    - `auto` (default): Automatically detects client capabilities ← **Start with this**
    - `stateful`: Maintains persistent sessions with connection state
    - `stateless`: Each request is independent, no session state

    Set via environment: `MCP_SESSION_MODE=stateful npm run start:http`
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Note>
**Alternative: Stdio Transport** - For MCP Inspector or CLI tools, use `--transport stdio` (NPM package) or `npm run start:stdio` (build from source). However, HTTP transport is recommended for most use cases.
</Note>

**Available CLI Options**:

| Option | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `--tools <path>` | Override YAML tools path | `--tools ./my-configs` |
| `--toolsets <list>` | Load specific toolsets only | `--toolsets performance,security` |
| `--transport <type>` | Force transport type | `--transport http` |
| `--help` | Show help information | `--help` |
| `--list-toolsets` | List available toolsets | `--list-toolsets` |

You should see output similar to:

```
✓ Server ready!
  Transport: http
  Host: 127.0.0.1:3010
  Endpoint: http://127.0.0.1:3010/mcp
  Tools loaded: 1
```

<Success>
✓ **Verify the server started successfully:**
- See "Server ready!" message
- HTTP endpoint is displayed (or "Stdio ready" for stdio mode)
- Number of tools loaded shown (should be > 0)
- No error messages about Mapepire connection
- Server process remains running (doesn't exit immediately)

**Server not starting?** Check:
1. Mapepire is running on IBM i: `sc check mapepire`
2. Firewall allows connection to port 8076
3. IBM i credentials are correct in `.env`
4. No other process is using port 3010 (HTTP mode)
</Success>

---

## Step 5: Test with Sample MCP Client

Now that your server is running, test it with the example Python client from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/IBM/ibmi-mcp-server/tree/main/client) to verify connectivity and tool execution.

<Note>
**Example Client Location**: The sample client scripts are available in the [`client/`](https://github.com/IBM/ibmi-mcp-server/tree/main/client) directory of the GitHub repository. Clone the repository or download the files to follow along.
</Note>

### Install uv (Python Package Manager)

If you don't have `uv` installed:

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

<Note>
**Why uv?** [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) is a fast Python package manager that handles virtual environments and dependencies automatically. It's the recommended way to run the client examples.
</Note>

### Run the MCP Client Script

In a **new terminal window** (keep the server running in the first terminal):

```bash
# Clone the repository if you haven't already
git clone https://github.com/IBM/ibmi-mcp-server.git
cd ibmi-mcp-server/client

# Install dependencies and run the test client
uv run mcp_client.py
```

<Tip>
**Already have the repo cloned?** Just navigate to the `client/` directory and run `uv run mcp_client.py`
</Tip>

You should see output like this:

```
================================================================================
AVAILABLE TOOLS
================================================================================
 1. system_activity
    └─ Get real-time IBM i system activity metrics

================================================================================
SYSTEM ACTIVITY RESULT
================================================================================

✓ Query executed successfully in 145ms
  SQL: SELECT * FROM QSYS2.SYSTEM_ACTIVITY_INFO

  Results (1 row(s)):
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  SYSTEM_NAME                   : YOURSYSTEM
  CURRENT_TIMESTAMP             : 2024-12-10-15:30:45.123456
  CPU_UTILIZATION               : 15.2
  MEMORY_USED_MB                : 8192
  ACTIVE_JOBS                   : 542
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

<Success>
✓ **Verify your connection works:**
- List of available tools displayed
- `system_activity` tool executed successfully
- Real data from your IBM i system returned
- No connection errors or timeouts

**Not seeing data?** Check:
1. MCP server is still running (check first terminal)
2. Server started on port 3010 (matches script's `localhost:3010`)
3. No firewall blocking local connections
4. Server logs show the incoming request
</Success>

<Accordion title="What does this script do?">
The `mcp_client.py` script:
1. Connects to your running MCP server at `http://localhost:3010/mcp`
2. Lists all available tools (SQL tools loaded from your YAML configs)
3. Executes the `system_activity` tool (a pre-built IBM i monitoring query)
4. Formats and displays the results

**View Source**: See the implementation at [`client/mcp_client.py`](https://github.com/IBM/ibmi-mcp-server/blob/main/client/mcp_client.py) to understand how to use the MCP client SDK.
</Accordion>

---

## Step 6: Run an AI Agent (Optional)

Now that you've verified the MCP server works, try the example AI agent from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/IBM/ibmi-mcp-server/tree/main/client) that can answer natural language questions about your IBM i system.

<Note>
**Agent Script Location**: The `agent.py` script is in the [`client/`](https://github.com/IBM/ibmi-mcp-server/tree/main/client) directory of the GitHub repository. If you haven't cloned the repo yet (from Step 5), you'll need to do so first.
</Note>

### Configure API Key

The agent uses an LLM to understand your questions and call the appropriate MCP tools. You'll need an API key:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="OpenAI (Recommended)">
    Create a `.env` file in the `client/` directory:

    ```bash
    # From the client directory
    echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here" > .env
    ```

    **Get your API key**: Visit [OpenAI API Keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Ollama (Local)">
    Install and run Ollama locally:

    ```bash
    # Install Ollama (macOS)
    brew install ollama

    # Start Ollama and pull a model
    ollama run qwen2.5
    ```

    No API key needed—Ollama runs locally.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Run the Agent

From the `client/` directory (where you ran the previous step), ask natural language questions about your IBM i system:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="OpenAI">
    ```bash
    # If you skipped Step 5, clone the repo first:
    # git clone https://github.com/IBM/ibmi-mcp-server.git
    # cd ibmi-mcp-server/client

    # Run the agent with OpenAI
    uv run agent.py -p "What is my system performing?" --model-id "openai:gpt-4o"

    # Or use the default prompt
    uv run agent.py --model-id "openai:gpt-4o"
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Ollama (Local)">
    ```bash
    # If you skipped Step 5, clone the repo first:
    # git clone https://github.com/IBM/ibmi-mcp-server.git
    # cd ibmi-mcp-server/client

    # Run the agent with local Ollama
    uv run agent.py -p "What is my system performing?" --model-id "ollama:qwen2.5"

    # Or use the default prompt
    uv run agent.py --model-id "ollama:qwen2.5"
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

**Example interaction**:
```
You: What is my system status?

Agent: Your IBM i system "YOURSYSTEM" is running normally with:
- CPU utilization at 15.2%
- 8GB of memory in use
- 542 active jobs
- System is responsive and healthy
```

<Tip>
The agent automatically:
1. Analyzes your natural language question
2. Selects the appropriate MCP tool(s) to call
3. Executes the tool(s) on your IBM i system
4. Synthesizes the results into a natural language response

**View Source**: See [`client/agent.py`](https://github.com/IBM/ibmi-mcp-server/blob/main/client/agent.py) for the implementation details.

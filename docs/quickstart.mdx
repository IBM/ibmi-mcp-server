Get your IBM i MCP Server up and running in under 15 minutes. This guide walks you through installation, configuration, and your first successful tool execution.

---

## Before You Begin

Complete these prerequisites before starting the installation:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Verify Node.js Installation">
    Ensure Node.js 18 or higher is installed on your development machine:

    ```bash
    node --version
    # Should show v18.0.0 or higher
    ```

    **Don't have Node.js?** Download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Install Mapepire on IBM i">
    Mapepire must be running on your IBM i system before proceeding.

    **Not installed yet?** Follow the [Setup Mapepire guide](/setup-mapepire) (takes ~10 minutes)

    **Already installed?** Verify it's running:
    ```bash
    # On IBM i
    sc check mapepire
    # Should show "running"
    ```

    **Note the port**: Default is 8076—you'll need this for configuration.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Gather IBM i Credentials">
    You'll need:
    - IBM i hostname or IP address
    - User profile with database authorities
    - User password
    - Access to QSYS2 system services (verify with your system administrator)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set Aside Time">
    Plan for 15-20 minutes of uninterrupted setup time.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Success>
✓ **Ready to proceed?** All prerequisites met? Continue to installation.
</Success>

---

## Step 1: Installation

<Note>
**Repository Structure**: The IBM i MCP Server follows a modular architecture:
- `server/` - MCP server implementation (main package)
- `tools/` - SQL tool YAML configurations
- `agents/` - Agent implementations and examples
- `apps/` - Deployment configurations (Docker, Gateway, n8n)
</Note>

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IBM/ibmi-mcp-server.git
cd ibmi-mcp-server/
npm install
```

Build the project:

```bash
npm run build
```

<Tip>
Use `npm run rebuild` for a clean install if you encounter any issues.
</Tip>

<Success>
✓ **Verify the build succeeded:**
- No error messages in the output
- `dist/` directory was created
- `dist/index.js` exists

**Build failed?** Check that Node.js 18+ is installed and all dependencies downloaded successfully.
</Success>

---

## Step 2: Configuration

Create your environment configuration:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit the `.env` file with your IBM i connection details:

```bash
# IBM i DB2 for i Connection Settings
DB2i_HOST=your-ibmi-host
DB2i_USER=your-username
DB2i_PASS=your-password
DB2i_PORT=8076
DB2i_IGNORE_UNAUTHORIZED=true

# Server Configuration
MCP_TRANSPORT_TYPE=http
MCP_HTTP_PORT=3010
```

<Warning>
Replace the connection values with your actual IBM i system credentials. The user profile must have appropriate authorities for database operations.
</Warning>

<Warning>
**Mapepire is Required**: Before proceeding, you must have Mapepire running on your IBM i system. Mapepire is a modern database server for IBM i that provides SQL query execution over WebSocket connections, optimized for AI agent workloads. If you haven't installed it yet, follow our [Setup Mapepire guide](/setup-mapepire) to install and configure it. Default port: **8076**.
</Warning>

<Success>
✓ **Verify your configuration:**
- `.env` file exists in the root directory
- `DB2i_HOST` is set to your IBM i hostname (not `127.0.0.1` if running in Docker)
- `DB2i_USER` and `DB2i_PASS` are valid IBM i credentials
- `DB2i_PORT` matches your Mapepire port (default: 8076)

**Having connection issues?** See the [troubleshooting section](#troubleshooting) below.
</Success>

---

## Step 3: Start the Server

Choose the transport mode based on how you'll connect clients:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="HTTP Transport (Recommended)">
    **Choose this if you want to:**
    - Connect from web applications or remote machines
    - Use Claude Desktop, VSCode, or Cursor
    - Deploy in production environments
    - Have multiple concurrent clients

    ```bash
    npm run start:http
    ```

    **Session Modes (HTTP Only)**:
    - `auto` (default): Automatically detects client capabilities ← **Start with this**
    - `stateful`: Maintains persistent sessions with connection state
    - `stateless`: Each request is independent, no session state

    Set via environment: `MCP_SESSION_MODE=stateful npm run start:http`
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Stdio Transport">
    **Choose this if you want to:**
    - Use MCP Inspector for testing
    - Connect from CLI tools on the same machine
    - Test in development before HTTP deployment

    ```bash
    npm run start:stdio
    ```

    **Note**: Most production deployments use HTTP transport.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

**Available CLI Options**:

| Option | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `--tools <path>` | Override YAML tools path | `--tools ./my-configs` |
| `--toolsets <list>` | Load specific toolsets only | `--toolsets performance,security` |
| `--transport <type>` | Force transport type | `--transport http` |
| `--help` | Show help information | `--help` |
| `--list-toolsets` | List available toolsets | `--list-toolsets` |

You should see output similar to:

```
✓ Server ready!
  Transport: http
  Host: 127.0.0.1:3010
  Endpoint: http://127.0.0.1:3010/mcp
  Tools loaded: 12
```

<Success>
✓ **Verify the server started successfully:**
- See "Server ready!" message
- HTTP endpoint is displayed (or "Stdio ready" for stdio mode)
- Number of tools loaded shown (should be > 0)
- No error messages about Mapepire connection
- Server process remains running (doesn't exit immediately)

**Server not starting?** Check:
1. Mapepire is running on IBM i: `sc check mapepire`
2. Firewall allows connection to port 8076
3. IBM i credentials are correct in `.env`
4. No other process is using port 3010 (HTTP mode)
</Success>

---

## Step 4: Test with Sample MCP Client

Now that your server is running, test it with the included Python client script to verify connectivity and tool execution.

### Install uv (Python Package Manager)

If you don't have `uv` installed:

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

<Note>
**Why uv?** [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) is a fast Python package manager that handles virtual environments and dependencies automatically. It's the recommended way to run the client examples.
</Note>

### Run the MCP Client Script

In a **new terminal window** (keep the server running in the first terminal):

```bash
# Navigate to the client directory
cd client

# Install dependencies and run the test client
uv run mcp_client.py
```

You should see output like this:

```
================================================================================
AVAILABLE TOOLS
================================================================================
 1. system_activity
    └─ Get real-time IBM i system activity metrics
 2. active_jobs
    └─ List currently active jobs on the IBM i system
 3. database_tables
    └─ List database tables in a schema
 ... (more tools)

================================================================================
SYSTEM ACTIVITY RESULT
================================================================================

✓ Query executed successfully in 145ms
  SQL: SELECT * FROM QSYS2.SYSTEM_ACTIVITY_INFO

  Results (1 row(s)):
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  SYSTEM_NAME                   : YOURSYSTEM
  CURRENT_TIMESTAMP             : 2024-12-10-15:30:45.123456
  CPU_UTILIZATION               : 15.2
  MEMORY_USED_MB                : 8192
  ACTIVE_JOBS                   : 542
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

<Success>
✓ **Verify your connection works:**
- List of available tools displayed
- `system_activity` tool executed successfully
- Real data from your IBM i system returned
- No connection errors or timeouts

**Not seeing data?** Check:
1. MCP server is still running (check first terminal)
2. Server started on port 3010 (matches script's `localhost:3010`)
3. No firewall blocking local connections
4. Server logs show the incoming request
</Success>

<Accordion title="What does this script do?">
The `mcp_client.py` script:
1. Connects to your running MCP server at `http://localhost:3010/mcp`
2. Lists all available tools (SQL tools loaded from your YAML configs)
3. Executes the `system_activity` tool (a pre-built IBM i monitoring query)
4. Formats and displays the results

**Source**: View the script at `client/mcp_client.py` to see the MCP client SDK in action.
</Accordion>

## Step 5: Run an AI Agent (Optional)

Now that you've verified the MCP server works, try the included AI agent that can answer natural language questions about your IBM i system.

### Configure API Key

The agent uses an LLM to understand your questions and call the appropriate MCP tools. You'll need an API key:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="OpenAI (Recommended)">
    Create a `.env` file in the `client/` directory:

    ```bash
    # From the client directory
    echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here" > .env
    ```

    **Get your API key**: Visit [OpenAI API Keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Ollama (Local)">
    Install and run Ollama locally:

    ```bash
    # Install Ollama (macOS)
    brew install ollama

    # Start Ollama and pull a model
    ollama run qwen2.5
    ```

    No API key needed—Ollama runs locally.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Run the Agent

Ask natural language questions about your IBM i system:

```bash
# With OpenAI
uv run agent.py -p "What is my system status?" --model-id "openai:gpt-4o"

# With local Ollama
uv run agent.py -p "What is my system status?" --model-id "ollama:qwen2.5"

# Or use the default prompt
uv run agent.py
```

**Example interaction**:
```
You: What is my system status?

Agent: Your IBM i system "YOURSYSTEM" is running normally with:
- CPU utilization at 15.2%
- 8GB of memory in use
- 542 active jobs
- System is responsive and healthy
```

<Tip>
The agent automatically:
1. Analyzes your natural language question
2. Selects the appropriate MCP tool(s) to call
3. Executes the tool(s) on your IBM i system
4. Synthesizes the results into a natural language response

**Try different questions**: "Show me active jobs", "What tables are in QIWS?", "Check system performance"

description: "Build specialized AI agents for IBM i systems using the MCP server and custom toolsets."

AI agents provide intelligent automation and assistance for IBM i system administration through natural language interfaces. The IBM i MCP server enables you to build **specialized agents** that focus on specific domains (performance monitoring, system discovery, security auditing) rather than monolithic agents attempting all tasks.

---



## Architecture Overview

The IBM i MCP server provides the foundation for building specialized agents. Agents connect to the MCP server, which exposes IBM i capabilities through SQL-based tools organized into **toolsets**. This architecture enables you to build focused agents that only see the tools they need.

## Building Specialized Agents with Toolsets

**Toolsets** are collections of related SQL tools that enable focused agent capabilities. Instead of giving an agent access to all 50+ tools, you configure it to use only the toolset(s) it needs.

### Example Toolsets

| Toolset | Purpose | When to Use |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| **performance** | System performance monitoring | Agents that track CPU, memory, active jobs, and resource utilization |
| **sysadmin_discovery** | High-level service discovery | Agents that explore available QSYS2 services and capabilities |
| **sysadmin_browse** | Detailed service exploration | Agents that dive deep into specific schemas and service categories |
| **sysadmin_search** | Targeted service search | Agents that find specific services by name or keyword |

<Info>
**Why Toolsets?** Specialized agents are more reliable, performant, and secure than monolithic agents. A performance monitoring agent doesn't need access to security audit tools. A discovery agent doesn't need write operations. Toolsets enforce this separation.
</Info>

### Creating Custom Toolsets

You define toolsets in your YAML tool configuration:

```yaml
# tools/custom-tools.yaml
toolsets:
  security_audit:
    tools:
      - get_failed_logins
      - list_object_authorities
      - check_password_expiry

  database_health:
    tools:
      - table_sizes
      - index_status
      - query_performance
```

Your agent framework can then filter to these custom toolsets when connecting to the MCP server.

## Agent Development Approach

Building an agent for IBM i follows this high-level process:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Define Agent Purpose">
    What specific IBM i domain will this agent handle? Performance? Security? Discovery?
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select or Create Toolsets">
    Use existing toolsets or define custom ones in YAML based on your agent's needs
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Tool Filtering">
    Connect your agent framework to the MCP server with toolset filters
  </Step>

  <Step title="Write Agent Instructions">
    Guide the agent on how to interpret user questions and use tools effectively
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test and Deploy">
    Verify the agent's reliability and deploy as a standalone service
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
**Multi-Agent Architecture**: IBM i's traditional separation of concerns translates well to specialized agents. Rather than one agent for "IBM i administration," build separate agents for performance monitoring, security auditing, database management, etc. Each agent becomes an expert in its domain.
</Tip>

<Note>
**Architecture Philosophy**: The IBM i MCP server encourages **specialized agents** that handle specific domains rather than monolithic agents attempting all tasks. This separation of concerns aligns with IBM i's traditional design philosophy and provides better performance, security, and maintainability.

description: "Deploy the IBM i MCP Server using container images, Docker Compose, or OpenShift with Kustomize."
---

Deploy the IBM i MCP Server in containerized environments for production use, team access, or integration with AI gateway platforms.

---

## Deployment Options

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Docker & Podman" icon="docker" href="/deployment/docker">
    Run the server using pre-built container images from GitHub Container Registry. Supports **amd64**, **arm64**, and **ppc64le** architectures.
  </Card>
  <Card title="OpenShift" icon="cloud" href="/deployment/openshift">
    Deploy to Red Hat OpenShift using Kustomize with source-to-image (S2I) builds, auto-redeployment triggers, and enterprise-grade routing.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Container Images

Official container images are published to GitHub Container Registry on each release:

```
ghcr.io/ibm/ibmi-mcp-server
```

| Architecture | Tag Pattern | Use Case |
|-------------|-------------|----------|
| **amd64** | `amd64-v0.3.1` | Standard x86-64 servers and cloud VMs |
| **arm64** | `arm64-v0.3.1` | Apple Silicon Macs, ARM-based cloud instances |
| **ppc64le** | `ppc64le-v0.3.1` | IBM Power Systems, running alongside IBM i |

<Info>
Images are built automatically by GitHub Actions when a new version tag is pushed. Each architecture gets its own tagged image.
</Info>

## Prerequisites

All deployment methods require:

1. **Mapepire running on IBM i** — The WebSocket-based SQL gateway that the MCP server connects to. See the [Setup Mapepire guide](/setup-mapepire) if not already configured.
2. **IBM i credentials** — Hostname, user profile, and password with database authorities.
3. **Network connectivity** — The container must be able to reach your IBM i system on the Mapepire port (default: 8076).

## Quick Comparison

| | Docker / Podman | OpenShift |
|---|---|---|
| **Best for** | Local development, small teams, standalone deployments | Enterprise production, multi-tenant, CI/CD pipelines |
| **Setup time** | 5 minutes | 30 minutes |
| **Scaling** | Manual (docker-compose replicas) | Automatic (pod autoscaling) |
| **TLS** | Manual (reverse proxy) | Built-in (OpenShift Routes) |
| **Image builds** | Pre-built from GHCR | Source-to-Image (S2I) from Git |
| **Monitoring** | Container logs | OpenShift console, OpenTelemetry |

<Card title="Not ready for containers?" icon="terminal" href="/quickstart">
  Run the server directly with **npx** or from source — no container runtime required. See the Quick Start Guide.
